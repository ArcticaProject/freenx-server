# dimbor: Check availability of direct connectioon to client's pulseaudio server
# at session start. If successful try to join spec sink/source
# "ts_receiver"/"ts_sender.monitor" on client's pa. These objects needed 
# to resampling in/out sound streams (typicaly 8KHz for telepohony).
# In case of absence these specs defaults sink/source be used.
# That's requires a very high-quality channel between client and terminal-server.
# Notes:
# 1) EXPORT_USERIP must be set to "1".
# 2) In client's puseaudio server must be loaded module

# To secure instead auth-anonymous it's possible to use auth-ip-acl=<ts_ip_addr;...>
#
# 3) To lower-quality resamplig load following modules at client side
